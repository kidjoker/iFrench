## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Xcode 15.0 or later
*   Swift 5.9 or later
*   An Apple Developer account (for running on physical devices)
*   Access keys/credentials for integrated services (see Configuration).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd iFrench
    ```
2.  **Open the project in Xcode:**
    ```bash
    open iFrench.xcodeproj
    ```
3.  **Dependencies:** Dependencies should be managed by Swift Package Manager and resolve automatically when Xcode opens the project.

### Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project requires external service credentials that **must not be committed to Git**.

1.  **Google Cloud Service Account:**
    *   You need a `service-account.json` file from Google Cloud Platform with the Speech-to-Text API enabled.
    *   Place this file **exactly** at this location in your project directory: `iFrench/Keys/service-account.json` (Create the `Keys` directory if it doesn't exist).
    *   **Crucially, ensure this file path is listed in your `.gitignore` file** to prevent accidentally committing sensitive credentials. Add the following line to your `.gitignore` if it's not already there:
        ```gitignore
        iFrench/Keys/service-account.json
        ```
    *   The application likely reads the API key needed for `QuestionService` transcription from this file or a separate configuration mechanism (e.g., a `Configuration.swift` file not shown, potentially reading from environment variables or a plist). Verify how `Configuration.googleCloudApiKey` gets its value.

2.  **DeepSeek AI API Key:**
    *   The `DeepSeekService` likely requires an API key. Determine how this key is provided to the service (e.g., environment variable, configuration file, direct initialization - **avoid hardcoding!**) and configure it accordingly. Ensure this key is also ignored by Git if stored in a file.

3.  **Authentication Backend:**
    *   Configure any necessary settings for your chosen authentication provider (e.g., Firebase project configuration via `GoogleService-Info.plist` if using Firebase). Ensure sensitive configuration files are ignored by Git.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

1.  Ensure all necessary configuration steps above are completed.
2.  Select a target simulator or connected device in Xcode.
3.  Press the Run button (‚ñ∂) or use `Cmd+R`.
